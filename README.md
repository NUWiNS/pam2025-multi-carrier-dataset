# [PAM 2025] A Large-Scale Study of the Potential of Multi-Carrier Access in the 5G Era
In this repository, we release the dataset and scripts used in the PAM 2025 paper, *A Large-Scale Study of the Potential of Multi-Carrier Access in the 5G Era*.

## Datasets

In the Datastes, we release communication data collected in mobile scenarios across three cross-US datasets: Drive1 (from Boston to Los Angeles), Drive2 (from Boston to Atlanta), and Drive3 (from Boston to Chicago), focusing on T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T.

## Scripts

The Scripts folder includes functions for extracting data from the raw datasets and scripts for analyzing the data. Based on their different purposes, they are organized into various sub-folders.

| Task | Subfolder |
| :--- | :---: |
| Extract data from raw datasets | [process_datasets](./process_datasets) |
| Analyzing | [analyze_plots](./analyze_plots) |
